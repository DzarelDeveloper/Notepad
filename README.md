# Project-4: Notepad Application

## Description
This project is a simple Notepad application built using Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to write and save text files through a graphical interface. The application mimics basic text editor functionality and is lightweight and user-friendly.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure the following modules are installed:

- **Tkinter**: Included by default in most Python installations.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

2. Run the Python script:

3. The Notepad GUI window will open. You can:
   - Type text into the editor area.
   - Use the "File" menu to save the text to a `.txt` file.
   - Exit the application via the "Exit" option in the menu.

## Features
